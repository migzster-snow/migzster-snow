**`Digital Athlete — Fail. Learn. Improve.`**

I’m a Computer Science student at The University of Queensland with interests in physics and mechatronic engineering, building across full-stack software, ML/AI/data science, quantitative finance, and blockchain. I learn by shipping small projects, breaking things, and iterating. Fail. Learn. Improve.
